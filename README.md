# multitreat
Variable treatment library in Spark, inspired by https://github.com/WinVector/vtreat

See also the paper "A Preprocessing Scheme for High Cardinality Categorical Attributes in Classification and Prediction Problems", Micci-Barreca, Daniele.

I created this so that I didn't have to redo this very basic kind of data science work for each project.  I will keep any in-progress work in the 'beta' trunk until it is ready to be released to master.

This library will probably largely remain in Spark but I may add Python (numpy and/or pandas) implementations.
