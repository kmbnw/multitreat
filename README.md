# multitreat
A simple variable treatment library inspired by https://github.com/WinVector/vtreat

I created this so that I didn't have to redo this very basic kind of data science work for each project.  I will keep any in-progress work in the 'beta' trunk until it is ready to be released to master.

I initially wrote this for Spark but it was pretty easy so I added C++ and C# and will probably add more languages in the future.

Feel free to just copy the raw source files if you want.  The build scripts are merely for convenience and I picked the Apache License so you could easily add and modify directly in your projects.
